        <p>This page demonstrates a case in which the current browser
        recognition feature of jQuery doesn't give a useful value for Internet
        Explorer's version.</p>

        <p>The current version of jQuery doesn't check for IE's ( >= 8 )
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Document Compatibility Mode</a>,
        that makes it possible to render a page in a way similar to previous IE version.</p>

        <p>While it totally renders the page as if it was a previous version,
        IE doesn't change the user-agent to match that version, while
        using the document compatibility mode.</p>

        <p>Therefore jQuery, which its browser detection feature rely solely
        on the user-agent, keep detecting the IE version as the real browser
        version and not the version in use for the document.</p>

        <p>While jQuery gives the real browser version correctly, I think that
        for the most use cases this info is useless.</p>

        <p>For example, the easiest (only?) way to detect whether the css
        attribute inline-block is being rendered correctly is by checking the
        IE version, since other then ie &lt; 8 all the browsers 
        <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#t03">support it</a>.

        <p>Consider a jQuery plugins developer that decides to not mess his css
        files with css hacks such as: "*display: inline;"
        <a href="http://flipc.blogspot.com/2009/02/damn-ie7-and-inline-block.html">to
        set specific rules for ie6/7</a> instead he choose a technique similar
        to the one <a href="http://headjs.com/">headjs</a> uses and adds classes
        to represent the current IE version which later he'll use for setting
        specific rules. So for IE7 for example <b>based on jQuery's browser
        detection feature</b> he'll add to one of its main elements "ie7 lt-8"
        and in his css files he'll put "lt-8 {display: inline; zoom: 1;}"</p>

        <p>If this plugin will be used in a page that uses the Document
        Compatibility Mode to be rendered as IE7 - it will be displayed badly
        since it won't recognize that it's running under IE7 so the rules
        relates to IE7 in the stylesheet won't apply.</p>

        <p>This page demonstrate that situation.</p>
